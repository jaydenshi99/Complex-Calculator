# **Complex Number Calculator**

A simple command-line calculator built in **C++** to perform arithmetic operations on **complex numbers**. This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, operator overloading, and exception handling.

---

## **Features**
- Supports the following operations on complex numbers:
  - **Addition** (`+`)
  - **Subtraction** (`-`)
  - **Multiplication** (`*`)
  - **Division** (`/`) with error handling for division by zero.
- Displays results in the standard format `a + bi` or `a - bi`.
- Modular code design for easy extensibility.

---

## **How to Use**

### **Input Format**
- A complex number should be entered as:
  - `a + bi` (e.g., `3 + 4i`)
  - `a - bi` (e.g., `3 - 4i`)

### **Operations**
- Choose any of the supported arithmetic operations:
  - `+` for addition
  - `-` for subtraction
  - `*` for multiplication
  - `/` for division
